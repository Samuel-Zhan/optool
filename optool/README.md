optool
======

optool is a tool which interfaces with MachO binaries in order to insert/remove load commands, strip code signatures, resign, and remove aslr. Below is its help.

```
optool v0.1

BUILD:
  Update the submodule "FSArgumentParser"  (https://github.com/mysteriouspants/ArgumentParser.git)
    git submodule update --recursive
  
  During building, if CoreParse is missing, you should checkout another repository.
  Switch to FSArgumentParser directory, and clone the repository.
    cd optool/FSArgumentParser
    git clone https://github.com/beelsebob/CoreParse.git CoreParser/
  
  Open optool project with Xcode, and build, binary "optool" gotten. Move it into /usr/local/bin.


USAGE:
  install -c <command> -p <payload> -t <target> [-o=<output>] [-b] [--resign] In
  serts an LC_LOAD command into the target binary which points to the payload. T
  his may render some executables unusable.

  uninstall -p <payload> -t <target> [-o=<output>] [-b] [--resign] Removes any L
  C_LOAD commands which point to a given payload from the target binary. This ma
  y render some executables unusable.

  strip [-w] -t <target> Removes a code signature load command from the given bi
  nary.

  restore -t <target> Restores any backup made on the target by this tool.

  aslr -t <target> [-o=<output>] [-b] [--resign] Removes an ASLR flag from the m
  acho header if it exists. This may render some executables unusable


OPTIONS:
  [-w --weak] Used with the STRIP command to weakly remove the signature. Withou
  t this, the code signature is replaced with null bytes on the binary and its L
  OAD command is removed.

  [--resign] Try to repair the code signature after any operations are done. Thi
  s may render some executables unusable.

  -t|--target <target> Required of all commands to specify the target executable
   to modify

  -p|--payload <payload> Required of the INSTALL and UNINSTALL commands to speci
  fy the path to a DYLIB to point the LOAD command to

  [-c --command] Specify which type of load command to use in INSTALL. Can be re
  export for LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB, weak for LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB, upward for LC_LOAD_
  UPWARD_DYLIB, or load for LC_LOAD_DYLIB

  [-b --backup] Backup the executable to a suffixed path (in the form of _backup
  .BUNDLEVERSION)

  [-h --help] Show this message
